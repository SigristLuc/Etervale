# [Vulkan] A mid-frame flush submits drawing into a swapchain image that is not yet acquired

### Problem

`MGVK_FlushCommands` submits the frame's commands recorded so far and waits for them. It is called from:
- `GetData` on a render target written this frame;
- the uniform-buffer overflow (fork change 9).

The submission does not wait on `imageAcquiredSemaphore`. If those commands already draw into the frame's swapchain
image (UI drawn before a read-back), they write an image the presentation engine may still own. `Present` then waits on
the semaphore as usual.

The window-resize path (fork change 12) also submits with that wait. When a flush had already consumed it, the wait was
made a second time on a semaphore with no pending signal: `VUID-vkQueueSubmit-pWaitSemaphores-03238`.

### The fix in WingSim's fork (change 16)

`MGVK_Frame::acquireWaited` is cleared when the image is acquired. The first submission of the frame that has an image
waits on the semaphore and sets the flag:
- in a flush;
- in the resize path;
- at `Present`.

Later submissions of the frame do not wait again.

With the fix, the Khronos validation layer reports nothing in a zoom run of WingSim's setup screen. Before it reported
`03238` twice (and `00279`, which was a WingSim shader bug).
