# [Vulkan] Enable independentBlend when the device supports it

### Problem and the fix in WingSim's fork

`MGG_GraphicsDevice_Create` enables only `sampleRateShading`, `occlusionQueryPrecise` and `samplerAnisotropy`. A
`BlendState` with `IndependentBlendEnable = true` and different settings per render target gives a pipeline whose
`VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState` entries differ. The Vulkan spec requires the `independentBlend` feature for that
(VUID-VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo-pAttachments-00605), so the validation layers report it, and the result is
undefined on drivers that do not ignore it.

This change enables `independentBlend` when `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures` reports it, which is every desktop GPU
(NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, MoltenVK).

```cpp
if (device->deviceFeatures.independentBlend)
{
    enabledFeatures.independentBlend = VK_TRUE;
}
```

Repro: bind two render targets, set a `BlendState` with `IndependentBlendEnable = true`, `ColorWriteChannels1 =
ColorWriteChannels.None` and blending on target 0, draw, and run with `VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation`.
