# [Vulkan] Texture.SetData is not ordered with the frame's draws

### Problem

`MGG_Texture_SetData` records the upload into a command buffer from the transfer pool and submits it at once, with its
own fence. The frame being recorded is submitted later, at `Present`. As a result:
- every draw of that frame reads the new texels, including draws issued before the `SetData` call;
- a texture updated twice in one frame (once per view or per instance) shows only the last content in all of that
  frame's draws.

OpenGL orders `glTexSubImage2D` with the draws. Engines written against it update a small per-instance texture
between draws, for example a skinning or node-matrix palette, or a lamp table.

In addition, the `TRANSFER_DST → SHADER_READ_ONLY` transition waits only for the fragment stage, while vertex shaders
sample uploaded textures too (height maps).

### Symptom

With WingSim's A320 on the setup screen, the lit pavement under the aircraft and the UI icons alternated between two
states in single frames, by up to 85 levels. The A320 rewrites small textures every frame: batched node palettes (one
per instance and part, rewritten when the pose changes) and the lamp table. The 737, which has neither, did not show
it. Changes 14 and 15 together removed it; this note does not separate their shares.

### The fix in WingSim's fork (change 15)

- On the thread that created the device, while a frame is recording, the upload goes into the frame's own command
  buffer. The sequence is: end the render pass, barrier, copy, barrier. The next draw begins a new render pass, which
  loads the targets.
- The staging buffer is freed once that frame's slot has come round again.
- Other threads keep the immediate submission.
- `GetData` on a texture uploaded in the current frame first submits the frame.
- The transition waits for the vertex and fragment stages.
