# [Vulkan] A viewport set after SetRenderTarget is replaced by the full target at the next draw

### Problem

`MGG_GraphicsDevice_SetRenderTargets` only records the new targets. The render pass begins lazily, at the next draw
(`MGVK_UpdateRenderPass`), and that function sets the viewport and the scissor rectangle to the full target. A
viewport or scissor rectangle the application set between `SetRenderTarget` and the draw, the normal XNA order, is
thrown away:

```csharp
device.SetRenderTarget(atlas);
device.Viewport = new Viewport(x, y, w, h);   // a tile of an atlas, a band of a map
effect.CurrentTechnique.Passes[0].Apply();
device.DrawPrimitives(...);                   // draws over the whole target
```

On OpenGL and DirectX the draw covers only the viewport. On Vulkan the full-screen triangle of each tile or band
covers the whole target, so the last one drawn overwrites the others.

In WingSim the cloud shadow map is built a quarter at a time, one band per frame (`CloudRenderer.RenderShadowMap`).
Every band overwrote the whole map with its own rows stretched over it, the map's front depths moved kilometres
beyond the ground, and the cloud shadow disappeared from the scene: an overcast day was lit by the direct sun and
metered 2 EV brighter than the OpenGL build.

### The fix in WingSim's fork (change 8)

`SetViewport` and `SetScissorRectangle` mark the value as chosen; `SetRenderTargets` clears the marks;
`MGVK_UpdateRenderPass` applies the full-target defaults only where nothing was chosen:

```cpp
if (!device->viewportSet)
{
    MGG_GraphicsDevice_SetViewport(device, 0, 0, cached->width, cached->height, 0, 1);
    device->viewportSet = false;
}
```

(the same for the scissor rectangle). Viewport and scissor are dynamic state of the command buffer, so the value
recorded by `vkCmdSetViewport` in `SetViewport` stays in effect inside the render pass that begins later.
