# [Vulkan] Feature: read presented frames back without stalling

### Why

`GraphicsDevice.GetBackBufferData`, and `GetData` on a render target, submit the frame being recorded and wait for it.
A test that reads every frame back therefore runs with one frame in flight.
- Races between the CPU and earlier frames still on the GPU, such as buffers rewritten while being read or uploads out
  of order, cannot show up in such a test.
- WingSim's capture-based checks passed while the game flickered in normal play.

### The addition in WingSim's fork (change 17)

| Export | What it does |
|---|---|
| `MGG_FrameCapture_Start(device, downscale, maxQueued)` | Turns the capture on. |
| `MGG_FrameCapture_Pop(device, data, bytes, &w, &h, &frame, &drawn)` | Returns the next captured frame. |
| `MGG_FrameCapture_Dropped(device)` | Reports how many frames were dropped. |
| `MGG_FrameCapture_Stop(device)` | Turns the capture off. |

How it works:
- At each `Present`, the frame's own command buffer blits the presented image, downscaled, into an image of its frame
  slot, then copies it into a host-visible buffer of the slot.
- The buffer is read when the runtime waits for that slot's fence before reusing it. That wait happens anyway, so the
  capture adds no synchronisation.
- `drawn` reports whether a render pass wrote the presented image that frame.

WingSim calls the exports through `NativeLibrary`, as it does the timestamp pool (change 4).
